Todo lists; one the first apps you may be introduced to when learning ROR. I wanted to make a useful todo app that I would actually use and hope that other people find useful. One of my favorite things to do in my off-time is play video games. One of my favorite games of all time is Minecraft. As you may or may not know Minecraft is massive open-world game with hundreds of blocks that can harvested in placed anyway you want. As most players know, that projects such as farms, bases, and general aesthetics can be quite burdensome due to not only harvesting them but keeping tabs on all of the blocks you need. Planning your build ahead of time can save time and frustration. That is what i aim to do with this app.

This Minecraft todo list will be strutured as such:

todo_list
	name: (name of the project you are working on)
	Description:(to get an idea what todo items are inside that list)
	
	todo_items
		-notes:(just general notes you have about the build such coordinates certain modifications, etc.)
		-blocks:(This feature will be a dropdown menu/ search bar. There will be a database of blocks to select from. You can select multiple blocks from the dropdown list/search. Every block you check from the list will be added to your todo items and as you collet items in your inventory in game you can check off each block on your todo list.)
